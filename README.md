# Mobile-Robot
Matlab project for mobile robot of class (2,0) - model and manipulation. 
Robot's model was made in Simulink. 
Applied several algorithms of control for different generated signals (movement tasks). Created movement tasks: path following, to point, trajectory tracking. Used algorithms: 
1) algorithms resultant from linearization methods (Taylor's method);
2) Pomet's algorithm;
3) VFO method.
